                <h2 class="description">If you are interested in effective learning (just like me), chances are you’ve come across the terms “active learning” and “passive learning”. Those two terms are becoming increasingly popular - in my opinion, deservedly.

                <h2 class="description">Being aware of the differences between active and passive learning can make you a significantly better learner. Let’s explore how.</h2>

                <div class="sub-title">What Makes Learning Passive? What Makes It Active?</div>
                <p class="article-text">First, let’s define the two terms and what distinguishes them. The key difference between active learning and passive learning is cognitive effort, which just means: “Does your brain actively process the information while learning or not?”</p>
                <p class="article-text">Passive learning is learning without using much of your cognitive abilities to process the information.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Here are the two best examples:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point" id="memorisation">Simply reading (and highlighting) a text. Here, you just consume the words on the page without thinking about them.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Traditional lectures. Here, you just sit and listen in class to someone talking about something. Not much thinking is involved there.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">Essentially, passive learning is just “dumping” information into your brain. It feels easy, yet tiring, dull and irrelevant.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Active learning, on the other hand, involves significant cognitive effort to process the information.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Here are two examples of active learning:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point" id="memorisation">Solving problems based on learnt theory. When you solve problems, you have to actively remember, rephrase and apply theoretical foundations to the specific problem.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Explaining a topic to someone. By doing so, you have to actively remember and rephrase a topic and be ready to use your knowledge to answer questions.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">Active learning feels hard and effortful. Still, it also feels relevant, interesting and engaging. This is exactly where its magic lies. Why? Let’s find out.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">How Our Memory Works</div>
                <p class="article-text">When learning passively, we imagine our brains as mere containers for information, like a computer hard drive where you can just store things. When reading a book or listening to a lecture, we often imagine being able to remember the content just by paying close attention.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Unfortunately, our brains don’t work like that. We should much rather compare our brains to a computer memory drive, where only relevant things we might use are saved. Irrelevant information (or data in the context of computers) is deleted or overwritten. This is not a bad thing at all. The only problem is our brain’s inability to distinguish relevant from irrelevant in some cases.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Thus, if we certainly want to remember something, we have to convince our brain of the information’s relevance.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Why Active Learning Is so Fantastic</div>
                <p class="article-text">Let’s combine the puzzle pieces. As discussed, active learning requires cognitive effort and thus feels hard, yet interesting and relevant. We also know that our brains remember things it considers relevant.</p>
                <p class="article-text">So, if we want to remember a topic, we should use active learning methods. By actively processing a given topic, we make it relevant and thus worthy of remembering for our brain.</p>
                <p class="article-text">This is the magic of active learning.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Science confirms that. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1319030111">This study</a> from 2014 compared 225 studies reporting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) examination results.</p>
                <p class="article-text">It found that classes using active learning performed on average 6% better in exams and also saw 50% more students failing the class using only passive learning.</p>
                <p class="article-text"><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2792660_code375554.pdf?abstractid=2792660&mirid=1&type=2">This paper</a> shows that active learning is both positive for short-term and long-term memory, so it is always a better choice than passive learning.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Implementing Active Learning in Our Lives</div>
                <p class="article-text">Finally, let’s see how we can implement more active learning into our lives. Here are some ways:</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Find Relevant Things in Every Topic</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">In every topic, no matter how boring, find the part most relevant to you. You might see a practical use case or a connection to a topic that you know is interesting. To really understand that part, you often also need to understand the rest of the topic. Suddenly, the entire “boring” topic feels more interesting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Explain Topics in Your Own Words</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">This could be done via <a href="https://acquirable.ch/the-magic-of-learning/writing-summaries">summaries</a> or essays, where you actively paraphrase the information into your own words. Just make sure you are actually using your own words and not just shortening the source text.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">In my opinion, the best way to actively learn via explaining topics is the <a href="https://acquirable.ch/the-magic-of-learning/feynman-technique">Feynman Technique</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Solve Problems, Play Games and Build Projects</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">By solving problems, playing games and building projects, you are actively remembering, processing and applying knowledge. This builds new connections, problem-solving skills and signals relevance to your brain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Discuss Topics with Others</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Discussions make you remember and rephrase the information you have learnt. They also expose you to alternative viewpoints, reasoning and connections.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Use Active Recall and Spaced Repetition</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Active recall is about actively trying to remember information. By doing so, you signal to your brain that the information is being used and thus relevant. Additionally, you also learn what you need to revise. By doing this repeatedly after a certain time interval, you can retain a lot of information.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">The hype around active learning is well-deserved. By using active learning methods, you are more likely to remember things, get better at problem solving, and find connections and viewpoints you have never thought of before.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Active learning is effortful and hard. But in return, you will become more curious, intelligent, knowledgeable and successful.</p>
                <p class="article-text">So, choose an active learning technique appropriate for the topic you are learning and have fun!</p>
