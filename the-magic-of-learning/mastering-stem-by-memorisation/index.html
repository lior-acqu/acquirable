                subjects present a significant challenge for many students. 
                After years of poor grades, many people think that they are 
                “just not talented” in those subjects, but that is not true.

                <h2 class="description">Mastering STEM subjects is just like mastering 
                anything else. Millions of people have successfully done it. 
                There is absolutely no reason you cannot. In this article, 
                we are going to look at the main mistake people make when 
                studying for STEM exams and how to prevent it.</h2>

                    );">memorisation</span>.
                    In class, we are told to remember certain facts, words or 
                    concepts. Often, it is obvious what exactly we have to 
                    memorise.</p>
                <p class="article-text">For example: If you have a vocabulary test, it is clear that you have to memorise the vocabulary. At the test, your ability to recall the vocabulary is the main skill examined.
                <p class="article-text">Just like in language subjects, memorisation 
                    plays a crucial role in STEM subjects with one huge difference: 
                    It is not that obvious what exactly you have to memorise. Most 
                    people will learn the theoretical aspects of the topic by heart 
                    in that case. That seems logical and gives them the confident 
                    feeling of having understood the topic.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The problem: STEM exams mostly test your 
                    ability to solve problems instead of just recalling the theory. 
                    Because you have not practised problem-solving, you will be 
                    prepared insufficiently, even though you have memorised the entire 
                    theory.</p>
                <p class="article-text">One idea to resolve this issue is solving a 
                    lot of problems after learning the theory by heart. The additional 
                    problem-solving experience will certainly give you a small boost, 
                    but it won’t take you the entire way as you will quickly forget 
                    the solving process of most exercises.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">"Memorising" Probelm-Solving</div>
                <p class="article-text">To really get good at STEM tests, 
                    we need to find a way to “memorise” problem-solving.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If you have well memorised the French 
                    translation for “house”, the term “la maison” will pop up 
                    easily in your mind at the test. Our brains are incredibly 
                    good at this – recalling information after memorising it well 
                    enough.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If we could “memorise” solving problems, 
                    we could enjoy the same effect. Imagine seeing a problem and 
                    you don’t even have to think about how to solve it because 
                    you just remember how to do it, like recalling a word at a vocabulary test.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Good that this is achievable. Most STEM problems can be 
                    grouped into categories, where the tasks of each category have the same solution process. Here are some examples 
                    of categories:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point" id="memorisation">Tasks where you have to find the definite integral of a polynomial function</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Tasks where you have to calculate the airtime of an object in free fall</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">While solving problems, pay attention to the category 
                    of problem you are dealing with. If you have no problem solving it, do 2-3 
                    additional problems of that category and then leave it.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If you struggle with a specific category, do this:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Try to understand how to solve it by looking at the solutions or using tools like Wolfram Alpha.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Once you know how to solve it, create a “manual” for solving this kind of problem (e.g. First you do this, then you do that. After that, you will do this etc.).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Learn the “manual” by heart.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">Once you have done this for every type of problem, most tasks at the test will be a piece of cake.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If you happen to encounter a complex problem you 
                    didn’t prepare for, your profound understanding of the theory and the 
                    other types of problems will help you master also this hurdle. 
                    You will also have more time to solve those complex tasks as you 
                    will need less time solving the other ones.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">How to Prepare for a STEM Exam: The Full Process</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="article-text">Here is the full process of preparing for a STEM exam, summarising every step we have mentioned.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">First, you get an overview over all topics tested in the exam: Which topics do you have to learn? How much time is it going to approximately take you? When should you start?</li>
                    <p class="bullet-point">After creating a rough study plan, you can start learning the theoretical parts of all topics. Your first priority is understanding them. I usually do this with videos, mostly from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA" target="_blank">The Organic Chemistry Tutor</a>. Understanding a topic means being able to explain it to someone who has never heard of it. This is how good you should be.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">After having understood the topic, you should learn it by heart. This will be fairly easy.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Now you can start solving tasks according to the <a href="#memorisation">memorisation method</a> presented in this article.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If there is sufficient time, you can revise the theory, or solve more problems.</p>

                <div class="sub-title">Acquired: Mastering STEM by Smart Memorisation</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Memorisation appears in almost all subjects.</li>
                    <p class="bullet-point">In many cases, it is obvious what students have to memorise, but not in STEM.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">In STEM subjects, only memorising the theory will not bring you far since most STEM exams are about solving problems.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">When you also “memorise” problem-solving, you will significantly improve your STEM capabilities.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">We can do this by creating and memorising “manuals” for the solving process of each type of problem.</p>
