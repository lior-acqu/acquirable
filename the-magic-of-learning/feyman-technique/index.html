                <h2 class="description">When it comes to a lot of topics, our ability to understand things is equally or more important than our ability to memorise. We can memorise the entire Wikipedia page about quantum physics, but only if we also understand it, we can make any sense of it.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="description">The Feynman Technique addresses that issue. It tests and improves both our understanding and memory. Let’s explore how we can use it to our advantage.</h2>

            <div class="text-container">
                <p class="article-text">The Feynman technique is all about making us explain a topic in very simple words. If we have trouble explaining the topic that way, we know we don’t understand it well enough. The technique consists of four steps, contributing to a greater understanding and knowledge of the topic of your choice.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Feynman himself was a master of explaining highly complex things in extremely simple language. He was a pioneer in multiple fields and won the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics while calling himself an “ordinary man”. </p>
                <p class="article-text">Now, let's explore the details of the technique.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">1. Identify a Topic to Learn</div>
                <p class="article-text">First, choose a small topic and write it down on a piece of paper. The topic should be small enough to explain in 5-10 minutes, so a topic like “Math” is not a great choice while a smaller topic like “Bayes’ Theorem” certainly is. </p>
                <p class="article-text">The choice of a small topic gives us a better understanding of what we need to learn and what we need to improve. It’s far more productive if we can say “I don’t know Bayes’ Theorem.” instead of “I don’t know math.”</p>
                <div class="sub-title">2. Teach by Explaining in Simple Words</div>
                <p class="article-text">After choosing a topic, we now either write down everything we know about it as if we are explaining it to a child or we can actually explain it to someone without any prior knowledge. Please also include some applications or practical examples.</p>
                <p class="article-text">This forces us to use simple words and clear explanations. Because we can only explain a topic in simple, clear terms if we fully understand it, we can detect our knowledge gaps.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">3. Identify and Fill Knowledge Gaps</div>
                <p class="article-text">After detecting our knowledge gaps, we can now go through our study materials to acquire the missing knowledge gaps. Please do the same for the complex terms and concepts that we could not simplify and clarify in our explanation.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">4. Simplify</p>
                <p class="article-text">It’s time to prepare our new explanation. Reorganise your text and simplify the language and the examples, so the explanation becomes easier and easier to understand. After that, repeat steps 2 to 4 until the text is as simple as it gets.</p>
                <p class="article-text">By running through the steps again and again, it also becomes easier to memorise the details of the topic. Each round gets easier and we thus become increasingly confident and positive about the topic.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Advantages</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">It makes you understand topics incredibly well.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It makes you confident and optimistic.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It also helps you memorise the topic.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">You become better at explaining.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If you write down your explanation, you are left with a fantastic piece of paper that can be very useful for future study efforts.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It makes you explore new topics you have not known before.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Disadvantages</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">It takes a lot of time, therefore it is certainly not suited for a test on the next day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Whe  You Should Use the Method</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">When you want to understand and memorise a topic very well.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If you’d genuinely like to deeply explore a topic.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If you want to improve your explanatory skills.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If you want to spark your confidence and curiosity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">When You Should Avoid It</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">If you have to memorise something quickly, e.g. to study for a test on the next day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Tips to Get the Most out of It</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Go through steps 2-4 multiple times.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Keep up a curious attitude (not just while using the Feynman Technique, but also in life).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Be honest with yourself. Is there a way to explain this in even simpler terms? Do I really understand this part of the topic?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">The Feynman Technique is fantastic if you want to understand and memorise a topic deeply. It takes time and effort, but your great understanding and knowledge and your confident, positive attitude towards the topic after using the technique speak highly in favour of it.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">A Challenge for You</div>
                <p class="article-text">Select a topic of your choice, try out the technique and see yourself become knowledgeable and confident.</p>
