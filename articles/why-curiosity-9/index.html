                <h2 class="description">What do Aristotle, Albert Einstein, and James Dyson have in common? Well, a lot. They are incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable and have made remarkable contributions to their respective fields. </h2><h2 class="description">Aristoteles built up the fundamentals of logic, theory, philosophy, and rhetoric, Einstein changed our understanding of modern physics and discovered groundbreaking phenomena, and Dyson significantly improved the vacuum cleaner after self-reportedly testing over 5100 prototypes.</h2><h2 class="description">Apart from intelligence, what made it possible for them to have enough inspiration, grit, and motivation to discover and develop these amazing things?</h2>

<p class='article-text'>The answer is curiosity.</p>
<div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>If Aristotle weren’t curious about nature and just sat around each day eating tasty Greek olives, he would have made no academic advancements.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>If Einstein didn’t want to find out more about the behavior of atoms, time, and particles, he wouldn’t have discovered the photoelectric effect and the theory of relativity.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>If Dyson weren’t interested in improving the vacuum cleaner, he would have probably given up after the first failed prototype.</p>

<p class='article-text'>Here are 7 other ways curiosity enriches our lives.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us Realize How Big the World Is</div>
<p class='article-text'>When we are curious, we allow ourselves to experience more of the world. We then realize how big it really is and that we can always learn something new that makes our lives better. There’s always a new area to discover, an invention to create, and a new question to ask. We can go in any direction we want and never run out of things to uncover.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Seeing this transforms us into humble lifelong learners who get smarter every day and know how little they know.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us More Open-Minded</div>
<p class='article-text'>Since curiosity makes us see how vast the world really is and how little we know, we become more open-minded.</p>
<p class='article-text'>If we think we know everything we need to know, it’s obvious that we become defensive, neurotic, and judgmental of novelty. New things challenge our beliefs too much, so we shut ourselves off and refuse to learn new things. This is a recipe for meaninglessness, stupidity, and sadness.</p>
<p class='article-text'>However, if we accept the fact that we hardly know anything and there’s so much more to discover, each new interesting bit of information and each new experience suddenly becomes something that enriches our lives. Now, we find meaning in exploring and learning more and more things and thus become smart, wise, and happy.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us See Our Own Weirdness</div>
<p class='article-text'>We are all weird. Nothing about our cultures is normal. To see that, we just need to look beyond our own culture.</p>
<p class='article-text'>For example, one thing that recently surprised me is that romantic kissing is only a thing in 46% of the 168 cultures explored in <a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aman.12286#aman12286">this study</a>.</p>
<p class='article-text'>So, a majority of all cultures see kissing as weird and gross, whereas in Western culture, it is a very normal thing.</p>
<p class='article-text'>The kissing example applies to most areas in life. Curiosity makes us see how deeply our environment shapes our beliefs. Different environments result in different beliefs; that’s how simple (yet complex) it is.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us Less Judgmental of Others</div>
<p class='article-text'>Since we are all weird, we may as well give up immediately judging others. What might be weird to us is completely normal for someone else. Behind most behaviors we find “odd” or even “wrong”, there is a logical, psychological, or cultural reason.</p>
<p class='article-text'>So, instead of immediately seeing someone as weird, we ask questions to ourselves and, even better, to the “weird” person. Usually, people appreciate others asking about their background, and we get an opportunity to learn something completely new. Maybe, we even walk away with a new friend.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us Better Conversationalists</div>
<p class='article-text'>As thoroughly discussed in books like “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie, the key to a good conversation is to make the other person feel interesting, important, and valued.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Curiosity helps us do that. Since we gave up immediately judging others and instead now resort to questions, we automatically become more interested in other people. What is their background? Their interests? And their personality traits?</p>
<p class='article-text'>We become great listeners and thus fun and interesting people to talk to. Always assume that the other person knows something we don’t, because surprisingly often this is the case, and we can benefit from their knowledge, views, and experiences.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us See and Choose What We Really Want</div>
<p class='article-text'>As already discussed, we don’t know anything about the world because it is so big. If we then go a bit further, we will eventually also realize that we don’t know much about ourselves either.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Most of us don’t know what we really want. Our perceptions are so strongly influenced by our culture that we often just pursue the same thing as everyone else. This can be perfectly fine, but it can also turn out to be something we don’t want at all.</p>
<p class='article-text'>In Western culture, the ideal is being rich, successful, confident, and happily married. This is not a bad idea at all, it’s just not for everyone.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Because we know that nothing is “weird” or “normal”, we should find out what you really want, no matter what other people say. Ask questions, try things, connect to our “inner child”, and make the best of each situation to find what actually gives us meaning.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Curiosity Makes Us Creative Innovators</div>
<p class='article-text'>Our world is ever-changing, and we have no control over that. So, instead of complaining about it, we can embrace the change and become lifelong flexible learners and innovators. With curiosity, we can create incredible things to make our world a better and inspiring place.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Conclusion</div>
<p class='article-text'>Curiosity is one of the best virtues to pursue. It makes us the humble, motivated, and creative thinkers and doers the world desperately needs.</p>
<p class='article-text'>We learn to understand. To understand that there is always more to learn about ourselves, the people around us, and the world in general. We judge less and question, discover, and invent more.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Curiosity makes us let go of “good” and “bad”, so we can focus on creating “better”.</p>
<p class='article-text'>So, stay curious.</p>
