            <div class="text-container">
                <p class="article-text">First, what is a summary about? A summary is about finding the most important information and connections of a topic and writing them down in an easy-to-read format.</p>
                <p class="article-text">By doing that, you create a highly useful document for further studies. Additionally, writing a summary helps you understand, connect and memorise the key concepts of the topic.</p>
                <p class="article-text">According to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-014-9290-2">this study</a>, writing summaries also helps you estimate how much you already know and understand and what needs additional review.</p>
                <p class="article-text">However, writing a summary is not always the best choice. It is a very time-consuming way of studying, often requiring many hours that might not be available.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In case of some topics, finding out what is important and what isn’t is very difficult. <a href="https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/elt/article/view/0/47206">One study</a> mentioned that students struggled a lot with keeping focus on the key concepts when writing a summary. In such cases, other study methods may be a better choice.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">When Should You Write Summaries?</div>
                <p class="article-text">Summaries are especially useful if keeping an overview over the entire topic would otherwise be difficult.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If the key points and key connections are more important than the precise details, summaries are a great choice.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Finally, if you have to study the topic again one day, having a well-written summary will certainly help you a lot.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">When Should You Not Write Summaries?</div>
                <p class="article-text">As mentioned, writing summaries takes a lot of time. If you don’t have much time available, do not write a summary.</p>
                <p class="article-text">When it is hard to determine the key concepts and key connections, or the topic is very detail-oriented (e.g. vocabulary, where you have to learn all of the words by heart), writing a summary is not a good idea.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If the topic generally focuses more on memorisation rather than understanding and key points, you should at least accompany summary writing with a study method that specifically tackles memorisation like flashcards.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Tips to Get the Most out of Writing Summaries</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Read the entire text (or watch the whole video) you want to summarize before starting with your summary. That way, you have a good overview  over the topic an can already identify some important connections.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Never just quote or paraphrase the text. Never just quote or paraphrase the text. Write in your own words, use simple terms, explain difficult words. This is to make sure you really understand what you are writing and not just passively writing sentences. Read more about the magic of explaining topics in simple words in <a href="https://acquirable.ch/articles/feynman-technique-4">this article</a>.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Only write a sentence down if you understand its content.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Only write about the main points and connections, include details just when necessary.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Keep good structure, keep your paragraphs small and concise. Small, well-structured paragraphs also make it easier if you later want to make flashcards out of the summary.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Send the summary to your classmates. This motivates you to write in simple sentences with good explanations, so your classmates are happy with the summary. Furthermore, it gives you motivation to really understand the topic, as your classmates are going to approach you in case of questions.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Just like with any other skill, you can improve your summary-writing skills with videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/eGWO1ldEhtQ?feature=shared">this one</a>.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">To memorise, writing a summary is not enough. Use tools like flashcards to memorise the topic after making the summary.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">If you have plenty of time, you are able to recognise the important points and connections, and you want to create a useful document for further study (e.g. for flashcards, final exams), summaries are a great tool. If that is not the case, there are other great study methods to choose. In case you have to memorise the material, make sure to use additional study methods like flashcards.</p>
                <p class="article-text">By making sure you write small, simple, concise and understandable paragraphs, you can get the most out of writing summaries. Send your summaries to your classmates to motivate yourself to write structured texts that are easy to understand. I used to do this a lot during high school and was incredibly successful with it.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">A Challenge for You</div>
                <p class="article-text">Try writing a summary for the next topic where it makes sense to write one. After, conclude how useful, efficient and enjoyable the method is for you. Thank you and have a nice day!</p>
