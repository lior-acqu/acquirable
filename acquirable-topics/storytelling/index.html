                A few days ago, I was scrolling on YouTube when I came across a video with the strong title <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNuAv-42jzY">“Give me 9min, and I’ll improve your storytelling skills by 176%”</a>. I thought: “Well, I am a terrible storyteller, I might as well give him those 9 minutes.”
                </h2>
                <h2 class="description">Fast forward 9 minutes, and I was amazed. I then began researching more about the topic, watching TED talks and finding books. Now, I can present you the result: An article containing the best storytelling advice from absolute experts including links to their best videos and books. Enjoy!</h2>

                <div class="sub-title">Why Storytelling Is Such an Amazing Thing</div>
                <p class="article-text">What do you remember better? The plot of your favourite movie or the last PowerPoint you saw? Chances are, it’s the movie. But why is that the case? It’s because of storytelling.</p>
                <p class="article-text">For centuries and millennia, humans have shared knowledge via stories. Our brains are highly skilled at remembering stories. This is exactly what David JP Phillips talks about in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj-hdQMa3uA">TED talk</a> that I highly encourage you to watch.</p>
                <p class="article-text">He also talks about the reason why stories have such an effect on us. Storytelling creates emotional investment. Your brain releases hormones when hearing a good story:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">
                        Suspenseful stories with cliffhangers release dopamine, which boosts focus, motivation and memory.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">
                        Vulnerable, empathetic stories make you more trusting, bonding, relaxed and generous via the hormone oxytocin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">
                        Endorphin is released when hearing a funny story. It makes you creative, relaxed and focused.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Stories get people into moods that make them more positive, trusting and likely to remember. Therefore, it is a great idea to practice storytelling.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-title">Your Stories Are Good Enough</div>
                <p class="article-text">Almost every source I found during my research, whether that was a video, an article or a book said this one thing: Your stories are good enough.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Everyone has stories to tell - way more stories than we think we have. People want to listen to your stories, everyone loves a good story, especially authentic ones that happened to you, the narrator. You just need to make sure you tell your stories in an engaging manner. Let’s explore how this is done. </p>
                <div class="sub-title">Things to Do when Telling Stories</div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Structure your story</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">The start of a story is very straightforward. Give all necessary context and go right into the action. Tell when and where the story is set and what happened. This immediately immerses people into the story. </p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Do not go into unnecessary detail, just say the things they need to understand the plot.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Since the end is usually the most important part of the story, start with the end in mind. Choose a point in time to start that highlights the transformation that happens in the story. Change and development during the story make it more interesting and engaging.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">This means that you should start your story with a situation very different from the end. While telling the story, you build up context and suspense for the audience to then take them to a big change, the sudden transformation, which then paves the way to the situation at the end.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Talking style</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Vary your tone and sentence length. Use short sentences. However, sometimes, an easy-to-follow and well-structured longer sentence can give the story a unique touch. </p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Use the present tense.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Use a conversational talking style, talk like you would with a friend (even if none of your friends are in the audience).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Use direct speech when the characters in the story are talking. Also, verbalise your thoughts instead of just describing them. Example: “My boss shouted: ‘You are a disgrace to the company!’, which then made me think ‘Okay, this is it. I quit’” instead of “My boss was angry and shouted. This made me quit.”</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Try showing emotions in the story instead of just stating them. Example: “I turned completely red from embarrassment.” instead of “I was embarrassed.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Additional Tips</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Prepare a little bit, but do not overprepare, so the story comes off as genuine.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If you have trouble remembering stories (like me), make a “Stories for later” page in your favourite notes app.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">A few things to avoid</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Do not tell any story you would not tell at a dinner table with your friends and parents.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Do not tell any story you feel uncomfortable telling.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Do not swear and do not be vulgar. This can make the audience feel uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Do not tell unnecessary details. Keep everything reasonably paced and relevant to the story.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">You do not need to be an overly expressive actor. You are already the narrator.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Simple words are good enough. No need to use extra fancy language.</p>
