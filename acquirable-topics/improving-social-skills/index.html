                    Social skills are extremely important. They are the foundation of every interaction we have with people - and those interactions are the base of every relationship. Thus, social skills determine how good and meaningful our conversations, relationships and the opportunities we get from them are.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="description">Since social skills are so important, it is in our best interest to improve them. In this article, we are going to look at the two main approaches.</h2>

                <p class="article-text">I grew up very introverted and had poor social intuition. I was neither good at reading social situations nor at responding to them. By using both of the two approaches presented in this article, I was able to improve my social skills drastically while also enjoying the process. As a result, my conversations and relationships became significantly deeper and more valuable.</p>

                <p class="article-text">The first approach to improving our social skills is by learning through media, books in particular. Here are some of my book suggestions:</p>

                </div>
                <p class="article-text">Of this list, my favourite book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034?crid=3FXZDWSXJ0JPW&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7c9Fi1iXXCEpHRcIbSnSFHl8hLkksZPX7fN3aHyX9nud92M5iADGckEHfi8xDnzoMWu-g3txw0nIQj_lD02LrQ2T7JDfjnFE-hsIaTXXmyaexfTiayFOJSn0v4xtpKf1qKAh8kHhNCJ8G0HncsjSTqlcCj2okhHfNrM3fbU0dIZSzmLzpWgLQDzywrxbrEE5j87QWfeYhz6N7mA1XqMneyVmmbd__7pLRDxi-vnKXsg.q-COEYe1xO_MRVk4lCoHVQoetj1hfPDFnNHXkT3m_kM&dib_tag=se&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&qid=1741878662&sprefix=how+to+win%2Caps%2C336&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=acquirable-20&linkId=b29bdfe189741ad62b45b8039838ac13&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><i>How to Win Friends and Influence People *</i></a>. It provides a great start to your path of improvement since it talks about improving your social skills in a very positive, encouraging manner.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Reading online articles (just like this one) is also a good option. Just by looking up "How to improve social skills", you will find excellent advice. Another option is watching videos on YouTube about the topic.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The theoretical approach is fantastic for many reasons:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">You can learn from absolute experts.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">You decide how quickly you want to learn, there is no uncomfortable pressure.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">You will not only learn about social skills, but about psychology in general, which is extremely valuable.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">However, there are also some disadvantages:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">You will still have to make an effort to apply the theory to real life.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">What you read might not apply 100% to real life.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">The process will take a long time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">The Practical Approach</div>
                <p class="article-text">Learning through media is great, but what if you want faster, more real-world-based results? In that case, you need a practical and intense approach. It comes with significantly more struggles, but in the end, it will be worth it.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The idea is to force yourself to social interactions until you have an intuition for them. But who are you going to talk with? Friends and family are a good option. You can even tell them about your motivation to become more socially skilled, so they can give you advice.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Talking to strangers is an even more challenging option, especially because it is unpredictable and a bit scary. In some countries, though, this is a no-go and you might face a lot of rejection.</p>
                <p class="article-text">My favourite option is getting a job where you <b>have to</b> talk to a lot of strangers for at least one day per week. You could do this in sales, in a restaurant, as a receptionist, in a shop or at a bar. Such jobs force you to have hundreds of daily conversations with absolute strangers willing to talk to you.</p>
                <p class="article-text">This offers you countless opportunities to practice. You can train your confidence, talk in different styles to see how people react, try out new jokes, learn how to read people and find good ways to deal with mistakes and awkward pauses. The amount of practice you get through such a job is invaluable. Pretty soon, talking to anyone will feel almost intuitive to you.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Acquired Topic: Improving Social Skills</div>
                <p class="article-text">Social skills are very important since they are the best way to get to know people, improve your existing relationships and get more opportunities.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Learning through media is great since you can learn at your own pace without pressure. You will also learn a lot about psychology as a bonus.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If you want quick results, my suggestion is getting a job where social interactions happen in large amounts on a daily basis.</p>
                <p class="article-text">For the best results, you can combine both the theoretical and the practical approach and become an experienced and knowledgeable speaker and listener. This was exactly the right thing for me. The combination of reading psychology books and working in customer service was helpful, interesting and fun.</p>
                <p class="article-text">No matter which approach you choose, you will benefit. So, give it a try!</p>
