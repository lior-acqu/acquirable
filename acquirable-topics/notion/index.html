                <h2 class="description">On the other hand, the sheer amount of functions made it very difficult for me to get started. But this does not have to be this way. In this article, I will tell you how exactly I managed to master Notion.</h2>

                <div class="sub-title">Amazing Flexibility</div>
                <p class="article-text">If I had to describe Notion in one word, it would be “flexible”. Notion has no clear structure, the structure is up to you and your needs. You can use it just to write down a few bullet points, but you can also use it to manage the internal processes of an entire company.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Notion has countless functions apart from bullet points you can use to your advantage. A few examples:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Pages, sub-pages, links to other Notion pages</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Databases with different views, filters and sorting functions</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Database entry templates</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Buttons</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Columns</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Code blocks</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Programming with formulas</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Plug-ins from many other apps (e.g. Google Drive, Google Maps, GitHub, Slack, Figma and many more).</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">When I got started with Notion, almost none of these things said anything to me. I was extremely overwhelmed with all of those functions and the lack of a given structure.</p>
                <p class="article-text">As a result, I quit Notion about five times. For me, it was just a highly confusing note-taking app at that time.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Today, it is my favourite app - by far. This is what I use it for:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Taking notes</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Organising my projects (yes, also Acquirable)</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Storing my ideas</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Tracking my habits</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Tracking my goals</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Journaling to write down my thoughts, emotions and values</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Writing down what I have learnt</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Saving useful websites and videos</p>

                <div class="sub-title">How to Master Notion</div>
                <p class="article-text">It took me about three years to get to where I am now. You certainly don’t want to wait three years.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The good thing is that most of my knowledge comes from one video I watched a few months ago. It covers every function Notion has to offer, from the most basic to the most advanced ones. It is a two-hour investment to save you dozens of hours finding out everything yourself.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Now, I am happy to share the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOf3QSBV29Y">link</a> with you. </p>
                <div class="sub-title">How I Recommend Watching This Video</div>
                <p class="article-text">Have a window of Notion open while watching this video to try the things shown in the tutorial.</p>
                <p class="article-text">I made a page called “Notion Tutorial” where I added every function I found useful. Now, I have a page to come back to when making a new Notion page to see what’s possible and how it is done.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Further Recommendations</div>
                <p class="article-text">Recently, I was scrolling on Pinterest when I found one of the most useful tools I have ever seen.</p>                
                <p class="article-text">I often face the problem of finding an interesting website or an interesting video but having no time for it right now. As a result, those videos and websites often get lost.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The tool I found fixes this problem in an instant. It is a browser extension called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.com/web-clipper">Notion Web Clipper</a> that allows me to save every website or video on Notion to visit or watch it later.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Now, I have a separate Notion page for all the useful and interesting websites and videos I have found to come back to.</p>
                <p class="article-text">To get some inspiration on how to organise your Notion, look up “Notion Setup” on YouTube and watch the videos that sound interesting to you. Another great search term to look up is “Notion Second Brain”.</p>
                <p class="article-text">You can do the same on other platforms like Pinterest. Try out the things you see and stick to what works for you.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The content creator and author Tiago Forte has even written a book about building a second brain using apps like Notion. I can only recommend watching some of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoForte">his videos</a> and checking out <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/3FPQ5e3">his book</a>!</p>
                <p class="article-text affiliate-note">(Note: The link to his book is an Amazon affiliate link. If you buy this book via this link, I earn a commission at no additional cost to you.

                <p class="article-text">With enough practice, I am certain that Notion will become an understandable and useful tool for you to organise your life.</p>
