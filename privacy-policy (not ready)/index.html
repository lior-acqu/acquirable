                    From the EU's perspective, the data processing takes place in a third country for which there is no adequacy decision by the EU Commission.

This can be done through the use of standard contractual clauses, in the case of data transfers within a corporate group through so-called Binding Corporate Rules, through an obligation to comply with codes of conduct that have been declared generally applicable by the Commission or through certification of the processing operation.</p>
                    <p>The legal basis for the transmission of personal data is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 6 FADP or Art. 31 para. 2 FADP and pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, which you have given on our website.</p>
