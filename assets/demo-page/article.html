                <h2 class="description">A few days ago, I was randomly scrolling on YouTube until I came across a video with the strong title “Give me 9min, and I’ll improve your storytelling skills by 176%” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNuAv-42jzY). I thought: “Well, I am a terrible storyteller, I might as well give him those 9 minutes.”</h2><h2 class="description">Fast forward 9 minutes, and I was amazed.

            <div class='text-container'><div class='sub-title'>Why storytelling is such an amazing thing</div><p class='article-text'>What do you remember better? The plot of your favourite movie or the last PowerPoint you saw? Chances are, it’s the movie. But why is that the case? It’s because of storytelling.</p><p class='article-text'>For centuries and millennia, humans have shared knowledge via stories. Our brains are highly skilled at remembering stories. This is exactly what David JP Phillips talks about in his TED talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj-hdQMa3uA) that I highly encourage you to watch.</p><p class='article-text'>He also talks about the reason why stories have such an effect on us. Storytelling creates emotional investment. Your brain releases hormones when hearing a good story:</p><div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>Suspenseful stories with cliffhangers release dopamine, which boosts focus, motivation and memory.</p><p class='bullet-point'>Vulnerable, empathetic stories make you more trusting, bonding, relaxed and generous via the hormone oxytocin.</p><p class='bullet-point'>Endorphin is released when hearing a funny story. It makes you creative, relaxed and focused.</p></div><p class='article-text'>Stories get people into moods that make them more positive, trusting and likely to remember. Therefore, it is a great idea to practice storytelling.</p><div class='sub-title'>Your stories are good enough</div><p class='article-text'>Almost every source I found during my research, whether that was a video, an article or a book said this one thing: Your stories are good enough.</p><p class='article-text'>Everyone has stories to tell - way more stories than we think we have. People want to listen to your stories, everyone loves a good story, especially authentic ones that happened to you, the narrator. You just need to make sure you tell your stories in an engaging manner. Let’s explore how this is done. </p>

Give all necessary context and go right into the action. Tell when and where the story is set and what happened. This immediately immerses people into the story. </p><p class='article-text'>Do not go into unnecessary detail, just say the things they need to understand the plot.</p>
