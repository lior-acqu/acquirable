                <p class="article-text">Now, after reading it, I understand why this book is on every bookshelf and has been sold over 40 million times.</p>                
                <p class="article-text">It contains extremely valuable knowledge.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The book consists of easily understandable and straightforward habits (as the book title promises), including reasons why each habit is important and how to actually implement it in your life. It does so in a highly sensible and systematic way. So, let’s dive into it.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">About the Author</div>
                <p class="article-text">Stephen R. Covey was an author, educator and businessman. He was also a professor for many years and has written multiple books about self-leadership and management. His most famous book is the one I am writing about, “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People”.</p>
                <p class="article-text">His son, Sean Covey, continues his legacy and added new, modern insights to the book.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Key Takeaways</div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Introductory Ideas</div>
                <p class="article-text">The author begins the book by presenting two ethics of growth: The Personality Ethic and the Character Ethic.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Most modern self-help books follow the Personality Ethic. They give clear directives on how to change your behaviour to get what you want. It offers quick solutions on how to live better and be more likeable.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The Character Ethic focuses on building character. It doesn’t show you a trick to seem more likeable or happy, but helps you cultivate habits that actually make you more likeable or happy.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Covey strictly pursues the character ethic in his book. He presents mindset shifts, not superficial tricks, and sees habits as the best way to incorporate these shifts into your life.</p>
                <p class="article-text">As the title suggests, this book consists of 7 habits to make you more effective in whatever you want to do in life. Let’s explore them.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 1: Be Proactive</div>
                <p class="article-text">Things are happening in life, both good and bad. Some things are in our control, most are not. Sometimes, things will happen to us that we can’t control, but we can control our response to them.</p>
                <p class="article-text">We can feel pity for ourselves and drown in self-directed sorrow, or we can step up, embrace the situation and try to change it for the better. This is what Habit 1 is about. We are responsible for our own lives (the word responsibility literally comes from response-ability, our ability to respond), and by being proactive, we all have the power to change things for the better.</p>
                <p class="article-text">We all have a circle of concern consisting of everything relevant to us. Inside, there is a circle of influence consisting of what we can control. Proactive people widen their circle of influence, reactive people shrink it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="graphic">
                <img src="Cicles-t7hohep.png" alt="Circle of Concern, Circle of Influence" class="article-img"
                style="width: 60%; text-align: center;">
                <p class="img-desc">The Circle of Concern and the Circle of Influence.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                <p class="article-text">So, take responsibility, be proactive, change your life for the better.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</div>
                <p class="article-text">Everyone with an ambition needs a plan for it, just like you can’t build a house without a blueprint. Great things are always created twice, once as a vision, a plan, and then once as the real thing.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Habit 2 is about making the blueprint. Covey’s blueprint for life is the mission statement. A mission statement consists of our deepest affirmations, goals and values. It is principle-based because principles are not fleeting. By focusing on our own principles instead of external factors in our mission statement, we truly become independent.</p>
                <p class="article-text">To write a mission statement, set aside some time for yourself. The goal is to bring your deepest, truest principle to paper. To find those principles, think about how you would like to be remembered, what roles you have in life, what you want to achieve, who you want to be, or what you think and write about most. To help you with this, the Coveys have made a <a target="_blank" href="https://msb.franklincovey.com/personal/">mission statement builder</a>.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Feel free to share the mission statement with others and regularly revise it.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 3: Put First Things First</div>
                <p class="article-text">In Habit 1, we learnt that we are the planners, in Habit 2, we made the plans, and now, in Habit 3, we learn how to actually execute the plan.</p>
                <p class="article-text">One can make a beautiful plan for a house, but it only has a purpose if the house is actually built. Unfortunately, our many commitments in life might prevent us from building our house. To solve this problem, we have to manage them. For this, Covey uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Eisenhower_method">Eisenhower Matrix</a>.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The Eisenhower Matrix tags problems as urgent/not urgent and important/unimportant.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="graphic">
                <img src="Eisenhower Matrix.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix" class="article-img"

                <p class="img-desc">The Eisenhower Matrix.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-container"> 
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Quadrant I (urgent, important) items need to be done immediately; they have first priority.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Quadrant III (urgent, not important) items should be delegated (if possible), not to waste time on something unimportant.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Quadrant IV items should be eliminated (if possible).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Quadrant II items (see how I skipped them before) are the ones that should occupy most of your time. They are in accord with your mission statement and prevent the crises that fill Quadrant 1.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">To find the Quadrant II activities that really bring you further, write down every role (e.g. parent, employee, sports club member) you have in your life and identify 1-2 actions that could bring you further in that role this week. Then, enter them in a weekly calendar.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 4: Think Win/Win</div>
                <p class="article-text">The first three habits make you independent. You become a principled planner, responsible for yourself. Now, you can start becoming interdependent, working together and building relationships with others to create great things.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The first Habit of interdependence is about adopting a win/win mindset: away from the competitive view of life as a zero-sum game to a cooperative view that sees success and joy as abundant and easier to grasp when working together.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Creating win/win situations is tough. It requires mutual trust, integrity, maturity and clear agreements. Win/lose, lose/win and lose/lose situations are easier to create, but only bring you misfortune in the long run.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</div>
                <p class="article-text">Everybody wants to be understood and seen as relevant and worthy. That’s why one of the most important (yet, unfortunately, underrated) communication skills is listening, more precisely, empathic listening.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The goal of empathic listening is to fully understand the worldview of the other party. You can do this by asking questions and showing genuine intent to understand them. Only when the other party feels completely understood, the empathic listener starts speaking (and in return is more likely to be understood, too). Now, the parties can find a solution that truly makes everyone pleased.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 6: Synergise</div>
                <p class="article-text">Habit 6 is the most rewarding habit of all. It requires everything we have learnt from the prior habits. Synergy is what can make us incredibly effective. It’s all about creating something with other people greater than the sum of its parts. In some way, it’s 1 + 1 = 3, or 10, or 100.</p>
                <p class="article-text">When independent (Habits 1 - 3) parties are willing to find a win/win situation together (Habit 4) and fully understand each other (Habit 5), they create an environment where creativity thrives and great success becomes something very achievable.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw</div>
                <p class="article-text">All of the previous habits require effort and a healthy body, spirit and mind. That’s why Covey wrote about another habit, keeping yourself fit - or, sharpening the saw. He identifies four areas requiring constant renewal:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Physical. Eating well, sleeping enough, exercising, and taking care of yourself.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Social/Emotional. Showing care and empathy, process your emotions, and help others.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Mental. Learning, reading, planning, visualising, writing. Keep on educating yourself. (<a target="_blank" href="https://acquirable.ch/about">Acquirable’s mission</a> is to support you on this exact journey.)</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Spiritual. Meditate, pray, explore and define your values.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">By taking care of those four areas, you make sure you have the resources to grow as a person and achieve your goals, no matter what they are.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">How I Applied the Book to My Life</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">I built a mission statement to gain more clarity on what I really want to achieve and who I want to be. I have already refined the mission statement twice to make it as useful as possible. If you want to build your own one, here’s <a target="_blank" href="https://msb.franklincovey.com/personal/">the link</a> again.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">I now try to plan every week with some goals I want to achieve and how I want to renew the four core areas of Habit 7.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">I try to listen more actively and empathically and create more win/win situations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">The Best Quotes</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">“Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.”</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">“To change ourselves effectively, we first have to change our perceptions.”</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">“If I really want to improve my situation, I can work on the one thing over which I have control - myself.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">What I Didn't Like</div>
                <p class="article-text">The book has a very long introduction that may as well be 10-15 pages long, not 60. Generally, the chapters could have been kept more concise.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">This Book Is For You if</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">You want to build habits that enable you to grow as a person.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">You want to become more effective and successful in your endeavours.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">You want to find principles and systems to base your life upon.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective" people is an absolute non-fiction classic. I genuinely enjoyed reading this book and gained a lot from it.</p>
