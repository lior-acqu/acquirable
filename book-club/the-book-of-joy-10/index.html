                <h2 class="description">A few months ago, I discovered “The Book of Joy” on Blinkist, a platform that offers non-fiction book summaries.</h2><h2 class="description">The book describes a week of conversations between the spiritual leaders Dalai Lama (Buddhist) and Desmond Tutu (Christian), supported by Douglas Abrams. The key topic of the conversations: How do we find joy despite all the suffering in the world?</h2><h2 class="description">To answer this question, the book combines knowledge from science, Christianity, and Buddhism, which I loved. This made me acquire the book in the first place and write an article about it. Now, let’s dive into the wisdom of two inspiring people about joy.</h2>

<div class='sub-title'>About the Authors</div>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>The Dalai Lama</div>
<p class='article-text'>His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, or Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet. He became the leader in 1950, just after the Chinese invasion of Tibet. Negotiations with China failed, and he had to escape into exile.</p>
<p class='article-text'>In the following decades, he continued to support his fellow people and became a Nobel Prize-winning advocate for goodness, peace, and joy.</p>
<p class='article-text'>He sees himself as a simple monk grateful for what he has experienced in his life, also the difficult parts.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Desmond Tutu</div>
<p class='article-text'>Desmond Tutu was a South African Anglican cleric who was very active in the anti-Apartheid movement in his country. He always stood for open-mindedness, warmheartedness, forgiveness, and non-violence, even though many of his close friends were murdered by the opposing forces.</p>
<p class='article-text'>He also won a Nobel Prize and became one of the best friends of the Dalai Lama. Together, they propagated the same values.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Douglas Abrams</div>
<p class='article-text'>Douglas Abrams is the author of multiple books about hope, joy, love, and happiness. He has worked together with many inspiring people, such as the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Stephen Hawking, Jane Goodall, Nelson Mandela, and the Gottmans.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>The Most Important Themes</div>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>The Source of Happiness</div>
<p class='article-text'>Both the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu see finding and creating happiness as the purpose of life. But how? It’s clear that external factors such as money, sensory pleasures, and status cannot create lasting happiness, even though many people seek it from those very places.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Lasting happiness comes from within and from healthy relationships with others. In this book, this source of happiness is simply called joy, thus the name of the book.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Science agrees with the two spiritual leaders. According to the psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky, the greatest sources of happiness are positive reframing, gratitude, and our choice to be kind and generous.</p>
<p class='article-text'>All of these things can be trained and improved. Joy is a skill.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Seeing Things More Positively</div>
<p class='article-text'>Our media are focused mostly on bad news. We read daily about wars, crises, and disasters. Bad things happen, yes, but there are by far more positive things happening in the world, they just make terribly boring headlines. Few would read an article with the title “Healthcare improved in Cambodia” or “Local family adopted a cute cat”. </p>
<p class='article-text'>But unlike the media, who make a living on bad news, you can seek out the good and positive.</p>
<p class='article-text'>And even if you face a problem or crisis, you can always see it from a broader, richer, more positive perspective. Each hardship is an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. So, seek out good news and reframe things positively.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Acceptance</div>
<p class='article-text'>While trying to find more positivity is a great idea, avoiding negativity as a whole is not. We are not superhumans, so we should not hold down our emotions and vulnerability. Instead, we learn to accept and embrace it.</p>
<p class='article-text'>For example, science has shown that sadness helps us find solutions, remember details, and be more empathic. It also drives support and solidarity. Why not embrace that?</p>
<p class='article-text'>We will forever be haunted by negativity if we don’t find a way to deal with it, so instead of suppressing our emotions, we accept and strive to understand them.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Compassion</div>
<p class='article-text'>The most-mentioned source of happiness in the entire book can be summed up in one word: compassion. Compassion is about thinking of others, embracing our similarities (and differences), being forgiving, generous, and empathic, and helping other people.</p>
<p class='article-text'>The two spiritual leaders see it as a medicine for most forms of pain. Here’s a list:</p>
<div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>Envy: When we are envious, we can also feel compassion by trying to feel happy for the fortunate person. Life is not a zero-sum game; joy and happiness are limitless, so there is no point in hurtful competition.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Grief and Sadness: Almost everyone has faced or is currently facing a difficult situation, whether that is the loss of a loved one or a mental problem. We are never alone in our suffering, and we can help each other out. Crises bring us closer together, as, for example, the fairly recent devastating earthquakes in Turkey have shown.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Stress, Fears, Worries: When we think of others, we see how trivial our stress, fears, and worries are. I might be worried about the opinions of others. Thinking of them helps me see that they face the same problems with stress, fears, and worries, maybe even worse.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Anger and Hostility: Compassion also helps with anger and hostility. Seeing our “adversaries” as genuinely good human beings, just like us, who only want to be happy and reduce their suffering, helps us understand their side and forgive the wrongdoings they might have committed against us. </p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Loneliness: By thinking about others and seeing our similarities, we see that we are never alone and can always seek out other people to find happiness. This is also true about suffering; we never suffer alone. People are in the same boat and willing to help each other out.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Happiness: Compassion not only reduces suffering, it also increases happiness. We are a social, interdependent species. We need others to be happy. True, compassionate relationships bring us the most joy.</p>
</div>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Humor</div>
<p class='article-text'>Apart from compassion, humor is also a highly reliable source of happiness. It helps us reframe negative situations, and when we joke about ourselves, we also boost our humility and likability. During the talks, both the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu constantly made jokes, roasted each other, and acted in an unserious manner - all while being famous leaders who went through a lot in their lives.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Self-Mastery</div>
<p class='article-text'>We are masterpieces in the making, not finished products. There’s a lot to train, master, and improve. One thing the Dalai Lama advocates for is training mental immunity, so when we face hardships and disturbances in our mental health, we can recover and move on.</p>
<p class='article-text'>It is based on the notion that we can’t control all of our circumstances, but we can always control our reaction. Crises are not a reason to get lost in suffering; they are an opportunity to grow, to learn, to triumph over our fears. This is how we can guarantee our happiness in the long run.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>Self-Reflection</div>
<p class='article-text'>All of this is only possible if we make sure to reflect. Without reflection, we would not know our problems, our emotions, our strengths, our weaknesses, and our hopes. The Archbishop Tutu prays, the Dalai Lama meditates. It is up to you how you want to reflect. I prefer meditation.</p>
<div class='sub-sub-title'>The Pillars of Joy and Meditation Practices</div>
<p class='article-text'>In the last few chapters, the knowledge is summed up again in the Eight Pillars of Joy: perspective, humility, humor, acceptance, forgiveness, gratitude, compassion, and generosity.</p>
<p class='article-text'>After that, there are over ten meditation practices and prayers on how to cultivate those Pillars of Joy.</p>
<p class='article-text'>If you are interested, feel free to send me a message on <a href="mailto:lior@acquirable.ch">lior@acquirable.ch</a> to get a summary :)</p>
<div class='sub-title'>How I Apply the Book to My Life</div>
<p class='article-text'>I now plan my day with intention in the morning and reflect on it in the evening. Each session includes questions about my gratitude and behavior on that day, especially towards others. My questions include:</p>
<div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>What am I grateful for?</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>How can I show kindness and compassion?</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>What did I enjoy on that day?</p>
</div>
<div class='sub-title'>Best Quotes</div>
<div class="bullet-container">
<p class='bullet-point'>“[...] the ultimate source of happiness is simply a healthy body and a warm heart.”</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>“You must long for the best for that other as you would want the best for you.”</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>“Joy is the happiness that does not depend on what happens. It is the grateful response to the opportunity that life offers you at this moment.”</p></div>
<div class='sub-title'>What I Liked the Most</div>
<div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>The highlighting of compassion as a great way of dealing with problems. Compassion puts our problems into a broader perspective and gives us a feeling of belonging and meaning. Apart from that, it also improves our relationships.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>The behavior of both spiritual leaders. They don’t act like serious, formal diplomats. Instead, they are “mischievous” (as they call themselves), lighthearted individuals who value humor and compassion more than formality and tradition.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>In the end, we get concrete meditation practices to practice what the book preaches.</p>
</div>
<div class='sub-title'>What I Didn't Enjoy</div>
<p class='article-text'>The book could have been a bit more concise, cutting everything that isn’t conversation or a meditation practice.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>A Similar Book I Recommend</div>
<p class='article-text'>“Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius. While “The Book of Joy” presents the Buddhist and Christian views on happiness, suffering, and the mind, “Meditations” presents the Stoic view on it.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>Who Should Read the Book</div>
<p class='article-text'>You should read the book if you:</p>
<div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>Want to find ways to deal with hardships.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Want to have more lasting happiness.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Are interested in religion, meditation, and philosophy.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Are interested in self-reflection and self-improvement.</p>
