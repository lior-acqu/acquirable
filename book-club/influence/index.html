                <h2 class="description">There are few books I have been recommended more often than this one. Many people told me it is a must-read for anyone curious about psychology. A few weeks ago, I listened and finally downloaded the book on my e-reader. Now, I can tell you they were right. “Influence” is a fantastic book. Let’s explore what’s inside.

                <p class="article-text">“Influence” by psychologist Robert Cialdini is one of the most popular psychology books in the world. It describes how people are getting manipulated by using very simple techniques.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Written in friendly, conversational language, easy to understand and well-structured, the book presents interesting scientific insights and stories highlighting the psychological effects of the presented manipulation strategies.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">About the Author</div>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Robert Cialdini is a professor of psychology at Arizona State University. Before writing “Influence”, he dedicated himself to three “undercover” years where he would learn from car dealers, fundraisers and other “compliance experts” who influence people for a living.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">His books became a huge success. He won multiple awards and is generally regarded as one of the most influential (no pun intended) psychologists of our time.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Key Takeaways</div>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Influence is structured into an introduction, followed by the essential seven influence techniques.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Introduction: Click, Run</div>
                <p class="article-text">Cialdini first tells a story about turkeys. Mother turkeys distinguish friend and foe by a simple sound: “cheep-cheep”. Other sensory cues play a subordinate role in her judgement. This means, a mother turkey attacks every being that does not go “cheep-cheep”, including her chicks, while embracing everything that goes “cheep-cheep”, even if it is dangerous.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In an experiment, scientists had a polecat model, a natural predator, make the “cheep-cheep” sound. The turkey embraced it and only turned hostile after the sound had stopped.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Cialdini calls this phenomenon “click, run”. Such phenomena occur when animals resort to cues, intuition and quick reactions instead of effortful, rational thinking. Some input is given, like a “cheep-cheep”, and the turkey immediately reacts without having to think. </p>
                <p class="article-text">While we may laugh at the “stupid” and “impulsive” turkey, we have to be aware that humans are also subject to “click, run” mechanisms. We rely on them especially when we lack information. All the following chapters of “Influence” describe tactics used to trigger such “click, run” events in humans.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Reciprocation</div>
                <p class="article-text">One of the most essential norms in human nature is the norm of reciprocation. When somebody does something for us, we feel naturally obliged to repay the favour in future. Reciprocation is not something bad at all. It is the base of all human relationships and transactions and brings huge benefits to society. </p>                
                <p class="article-text">It is only problematic when it’s exploited. This can be done by giving something in advance on purpose before asking for the actual favour. This works particularly well when the gift is personal and according to the other person’s needs.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The free (or not-so-free) samples in supermarkets provide a great example. Here, you are given a small piece of a product for free to try. A nice gift to you, the customer. After that, you are then asked whether you’d like to buy the product. Since people have received a favour, they are likely to return the favour by buying the product.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The rejection-then-retreat technique is another example of exploitation. Here, the requester first makes an extreme proposal, certain to be rejected. After the rejection, the victim feels like they owe something to the requester. Thus, when the requester then makes the real request, the victim is more likely to give in.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Liking</div>
                <p class="article-text">People are more likely to say yes to people they like. This usually makes a lot of sense. You would much rather accept an invitation from your best friend than a stranger. Still, the principle of liking can be exploited by making you like someone or something. There are multiple ways to achieve that:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">When we see an attractive person, we tend to make positive assumptions about their other traits. Thus, we are more likely to feel positive towards attractive people. This is called the “Halo Effect”, also described by famous psychologist Daniel Kahneman.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">By pointing out similarities or associations. We like people who are similar to us. By convincing someone of apparent similarities and “being on their side”, selling will become a lot easier.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">By cultivating a positive relationship. Cialdini tells the story of the most successful car dealer in the world who maintains thousands of customers by sending out cards saying “I like you” on a regular basis.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Social Proof</div>
                <p class="article-text">If we do not know whether something is good or bad, we often listen to the opinions of other people. </p>
                <p class="article-text">In China, the managers of a restaurant chain once labelled some dishes with the simple tag “most popular” on the menu. Et voilà, those dishes skyrocketed in popularity. This trick works especially well with uncertainty, when a large number of people is involved and when you're similar to the people who have already made the choice.</p>
                <p class="article-text">One fun, small experiment to test this phenomenon is staring up at a tall building on a busy street with a few friends. After some minutes, a crowd will have formed around you, joining you staring up as if you know something they don’t.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Authority</div>
                <p class="article-text">We are more likely to comply with someone who seems to be an authority in a certain area.  After all, you are more likely to buy medicine after a recommendation from a doctor rather than your neighbour.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Especially effective are people who are perceived as an authority instead of just in a position of authority. Such people are seen as trustworthy experts. To establish that trust, they can admit one minor weakness before then mentioning their strengths and knowledge to seem humble and credible.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Listening to experts is often a good idea, but it can also cause problems. It led to people not telling the chief surgeon he was amputating the wrong foot because they believed he knew better. The fairly disturbing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram experiment</a> is also a good example of how detrimental blind listening to authority can be.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Scarcity</div>
                <p class="article-text">People fear missing out on things and thus losing them. Thus, it is not surprising that people assign more importance to scarce things. Additionally, we generally see scarce things as intrinsically more valuable.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The combination of these phenomena makes the directed use of scarcity on people so effective. The mere thought of potentially losing something valuable if they don’t act now is often strong enough to drive people to make quick and impulsive decisions. I myself have often fallen victim to this.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The effect of scarcity also applies to scarce information. One trick vendors use to sell more products is by telling customers something along the lines: “I shouldn’t tell you this, but we just received a small additional supply of product XYZ. If you want it, you can buy it right now.”</p>
                <p class="article-text">The effect is especially strong when a thing has just become scarce or when others are actively competing for the scarce objects since it directly triggers our fear of losing something.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Commitment and Consistency</div>
                <p class="article-text">Another psychological phenomenon is the wish of people to be seen as consistent in their words, beliefs, attitudes and actions. Consistency is highly valued by society and makes navigating through the myriad of information in our modern times a lot easier. Consistently sticking to one’s choices is a shortcut that prevents us from constantly re- and overthinking.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Unfortunately, also consistency can be abused by compliance experts. They can do this by getting a small initial commitment out of us in order to make us stay consistent towards that commitment. Public, effortful, and voluntary commitments have the strongest effects.</p>
                <p class="article-text">A fundraiser might use such a trick on us by first asking us a question almost nobody says no to like: “Would you like poverty to be reduced?” After saying yes, they continue by saying: “Great! If you donate to our charity, you can help us reduce poverty!”. Due to the principle of consistency, many people then donate a small amount to maintain their consistent image.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Unity</div>
                <p class="article-text">Years after initially publishing “Influence”, Cialdini added another chapter to the book. The topic: unity. The car dealer he mentioned in the chapter about liking was surpassed in success. The best car dealer in the world is now an Arab car dealer situated in the largest Arab community in the United States.</p>
                <p class="article-text">His “trick” is using the principle of unity. A large proportion of the local Arab community buys their cars from him, simply because he is considered “one of them”.  This is due to our tendency to act in favour of people we consider part of our groups.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The natural factors of unity are race, nationality, regionality, ethnicity, family, political opinions and religion. By acting in unison, for example, when experiencing music together, a feeling of unity can also be induced in groups. That’s why music has a special importance in the military, where unity is essential.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">How I Apply the Book to My Life</div>
                <p class="article-text">Many of the compliance techniques described in the book are fairly manipulative. Thus, I am very cautious when using them.</p>
                <p class="article-text">For the most part, I apply this book in the way Cialdini intended it. It has given me the ability to regularly notice when I am being manipulated. Now, I also don’t feel bad anymore when I say no to a compliance professional because I know their tricks of making you feel “guilty” or “missing out”.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">What I Didn't Like</p>
                <p class="article-text">I read the new and expanded edition. For me, the book contained too many examples and stories. It could have certainly been shorter without losing any significant value.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Similar Books I Recommend</div>
                <p class="article-text">If you are interested in behavioural psychology, I highly recommend reading <a href=" https://amzn.to/3QZikJy">Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking, Fast and Slow”</a>, which summarises his Nobel Prize-winning insights on human behaviour.</p>

                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">“Influence” is a highly informative, engaging, useful and extensive book about human psychology. I sincerely recommend reading this book, even if it could be a bit shorter.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Or if I were a compliance expert manipulating you: After making this extensive summary for you, you should return me the favour (reciprocity) of reading this book, ideally bought via the Amazon affiliate link below. I am on your side, we both like lifelong learning and a good book (liking). The book is very popular (social proof) and countless psychology experts recommend it (authority). Apart from that, it will disappear from all bookshelves very soon (scarcity) and since you have already read this article, it would be a shame to skip the book (commitment and consistency). After all, we are a warm and honourable community of curious book lovers (unity).</p>
