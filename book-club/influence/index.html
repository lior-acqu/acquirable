                <h2 class="description">There are few books I have been recommended more often than this one. Many people told me it is a must-read for anyone curious about psychology. A few weeks ago, I listened and finally downloaded the book on my e-reader. Now, I can tell you they were right. “Influence” is a fantastic book. Let’s explore what’s inside.

                <p class="article-text">“Influence” by psychologist Robert Cialdini is one of the most popular psychology books in the world. It describes how people are getting manipulated by using very simple techniques.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Written in friendly, conversational language, easy to understand and well-structured, the book presents interesting scientific insights and stories highlighting the psychological effects of the presented manipulation strategies.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">About the Author</div>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Robert Cialdini is a professor of psychology at Arizona State University. Before writing “Influence”, he dedicated himself to three “undercover” years where he would learn from car dealers, fundraisers and other “compliance experts” who influence people for a living.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">His books became a huge success. He won multiple awards and is generally regarded as one of the most influential (no pun intended) psychologists of our time.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Key Takeaways</div>
                <p class="article-text">
                    Influence is structured into an introduction, followed by the essential seven influence techniques.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Introduction: Click, Run</div>
                <p class="article-text">Cialdini first tells a story about turkeys. Mother turkeys distinguish friend and foe by a simple sound: “cheep-cheep”. Other sensory cues play a subordinate role in her judgement. This means, a mother turkey attacks every being that does not go “cheep-cheep”, including her chicks, while embracing everything that goes “cheep-cheep”, even if it is dangerous.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In an experiment, scientists had a polecat model, a natural predator, make the “cheep-cheep” sound. The turkey embraced it and only turned hostile after the sound had stopped.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Cialdini calls this phenomenon “click, run”. Such phenomena occur when animals resort to cues, intuition and quick reactions instead of effortful, rational thinking. Some input is given, like a “cheep-cheep”, and the turkey immediately reacts without having to think. </p>
                <p class="article-text">While we may laugh at the “stupid” and “impulsive” turkey, we have to be aware that humans are also subject to “click, run” mechanisms. We rely on them especially when we lack information. All the following chapters of “Influence” describe tactics used to trigger such “click, run” events in humans.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Reciprocation</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">One of the most essential norms in human nature is the norm of reciprocation.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">When somebody does something for us, we feel naturally obliged to repay the favour in future. Usually, that’s a great thing.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Unfortunately, it can be exploited by giving something in advance on purpose before asking for the actual favour.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Example: The free (or not-so-free) samples in supermarkets. By giving you a small piece to try for free, supermarkets make us feel obliged to buy a product we didn’t want in the first place.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Equally, we often feel guilty after rejecting a proposal. That’s why compliance experts often make an extreme proposal to be rejected. This makes people more likely to accept the following actual proposal. This is called rejection-then-retreat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Liking</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People are more likely to comply with people they like instead of strangers.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">This makes sense in most cases since friends are on average more trustworthy.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Unfortunately, this can also be abused by creating sympathy for the salesperson.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">When a salesperson is attractive, pointing out similarities between you and them or seems to be “on your side”, we are more likely to buy.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Cialdini mentions how one car dealer regularly sends cards saying "I like you" to his customer base and as a consequence became the most successful dealer in the world.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Social Proof</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">If we are unsure, we often look what other people are doing.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">By choosing what’s “most popular”, we are less likely to make a bad choice.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Compliance experts use this trick to boost certain products by labelling them as “the most popular”.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">To see the effects of social proof in real life, stare up at a tall building with a few friends for some time. After a few minutes, a crowd will have formed around you, assuming you know something they don’t.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Authority</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">We are very likely to listen to someone who is an authority in a certain field (e.g. a doctor).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">This is usually a great idea, but it can also be exploited by having a seemingly trustworthy expert present something (e.g. a dentist presenting a toothpaste).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">The effect of authority is especially strong when people aren’t just in a position of authority, but are perceived as a trustworthy authority, too.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">he consequences can be detrimental. Assistants have not informed the chief surgeon that he was amputating the wrong foot because they thought he knew better. Another disturbing example is the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram experiment</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Scarcity</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People generally see scarce things as more valuable.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Additionally, scarcity also directly triggers our fears of missing out and losing something.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Compliance experts use this to drive people to quick, impulsive decisions under the constant idea that the desired thing might be gone the next second.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">When a thing has not been scarce before or we see other people actively competing for the object, the effect is even stronger.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Commitment and Consistency</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People naturally want to be seen as consistent in their words, beliefs, attitudes and actions.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Consistency is highly valued in society and gives us an alternative to constantly rethinking our choices.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">To use the effects of consistency on us, compliance experts try to get a small initial commitment out of us. Public, effortful, and voluntary commitments have the strongest effects.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Example: A fundraiser asks you whether you want less poverty. Almost anyone would say yes in that situation. This is the initial commitment. Now, the fundraiser asks you to donate money to his charity to reduce poverty. To stay consistent, many people now agree to donate a small amount.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Unity</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Years after first publishing the book, Cialdini added a chapter about unity to his book.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">The best car salesman (mentioned in the capter about liking) was overtaken by an Arab seller in the largest Arab community in the U.S. His “trick”: he’s considered “one of us” in the large Arab community.</p>                    
                    <p class="bullet-point">We are more willing to comply with someone considered “one of us”.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">The natural factors of unity are race, nationality, regionality, ethnicity, family, political opinions and religion. By acting in unison, e.g. by experiencing music together, a feeling of unity can also be induced.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">How I Apply the Book to My Life</div>
                <p class="article-text">Many of the compliance techniques described in the book are fairly manipulative. Thus, I am very cautious when using them.</p>
                <p class="article-text">For the most part, I apply this book in the way Cialdini intended it. It has given me the ability to regularly notice when I am being manipulated. Now, I also don’t feel bad anymore when I say no to a compliance professional because I know their tricks of making you feel “guilty” or “missing out”.</p>
                <p class="sub-title">What I Didn't Like</p>
                <p class="article-text">I read the new and expanded edition. For me, the book contained too many examples and stories. It could have certainly been shorter without losing any significant value.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Similar Books I Recommend</div>
                <p class="article-text">If you are interested in behavioural psychology, I highly recommend reading <a href=" https://amzn.to/3QZikJy">Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking, Fast and Slow”</a>, which summarises his Nobel Prize-winning insights on human behaviour.</p>

                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">“Influence” is a highly informative, engaging, useful and extensive book about human psychology. I sincerely recommend reading this book, even if it could be a bit shorter.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Or if I were a compliance expert manipulating you: After making this extensive summary for you, you should return me the favour (reciprocity) of reading this book, ideally bought via the Amazon affiliate link below. I am on your side, we both like lifelong learning and a good book (liking). The book is very popular (social proof) and countless psychology experts recommend it (authority). Apart from that, it will disappear from all bookshelves very soon (scarcity) and since you have already read this article, it would be a shame to skip the book (commitment and consistency). After all, we are a warm and honourable community of curious book lovers (unity).</p>
