                <h2 class="description"> 
                    A few months ago, I was exploring book summaries on the app <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.blinkist.com/en">Blinkist</a> and came across a book called “The Infinite Game”. It immediately caught my eye and had excellent ratings, so I gave it a read.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="description">15 minutes later, I was sold. I have never been so convinced to buy a book. It changed the way I think about leadership and the purpose of organisations. This change became even more prominent after reading the entire book. It was full of new ideas I had never heard of before. I was amazed and finished the book within 3 days.</h2>

                <div class="sub-title">About The Author</div>
                <p class="article-text">Simon Sinek is an author and speaker. His talks and books have reached and inspired millions of people. Nowadays, he also works together with many organisations and offers courses and a podcast. He describes himself as an “unshakeable optimist”. It’s therefore not surprising that his company is called <a target="_blank" href="https://simonsinek.com">“The Optimism Company”</a>.

                <div class="sub-sub-title">Finite and Infinite Games</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <div class="bullet-point">Organisations are in an infinite game.</div>
                    <div class="bullet-point">Finite games have strict rules, a clear beginning, end, and a winner (or a draw). A game of football is an example.</div>
                    <div class="bullet-point">This does not apply to the corporate world. Apart from the law, there are no other rules, organisations can start and stop operating whenever they want and they can’t “win business”.</div>
                    <div class="bullet-point">In a finite game, the goal is to win. In an infinite game, the goal is to outlast. That’s why organisations should not try to beat the competition, they should try to outlast them by constantly improving.</div>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">To do this, Sinek proposes 5 practices. Let’s go through all of them.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">The Just Cause</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">Every organisation needs a Just Cause. This is a goal “so just that employees would be willing to sacrifice their own interests to advance it.”</p>                    
                    <p class="bullet-point">In other words, the Just Cause makes people happy and fulfilled, even if it requires them to make sacrifices.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">To call a cause “Just”, it must fulfill these criteria:</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point indented">It is for instead of against something.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point indented">It is open to all people.</p>                    
                    <p class="bullet-point indented">It is generally beneficial.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point indented">It stays relevant at any point.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point indented">It is big and idealistic so it will never be fully reached, but we can constantly get closer to it.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Profit is therefore not the biggest priority. It is just seen as a necessary mean to continue pursuing the Just cause.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Trusting Teams</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">The most important factor in an organisation are the employees. They are the ones making the products and selling them to happy customers.</p>                    
                    <p class="bullet-point">Thus, they should be a priority.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">According to Sinek, a leader’s task is to create an environment where employees can work at their natural best. They are not responsible for the results, but for the people responsible for the results.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">A trusting team is one where employees feel safe talking about problems, mistakes and questions.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It takes time to build such a team, but it is worth it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">A Worthy Rival</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">In the infinite game, your only true competitor is yourself. Trying to be better than anyone else is therefore pointless and only creates envy.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Still, having a worthy rival is a great idea because you can learn from their strengths to improve ourselves.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Simon Sinek has experienced rivalry himself. He talked about feeling insecure when comparing himself to Adam Grant, another author. Now, they are good friends and even work together because “it turns out, people can buy more than one book”.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Existential Flexibility</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">The only constant in an organisation is the just cause, the rest, including the entire product line can change.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If something in the organisation fails to further help the company pursue the Just Cause, it should be changed. This is what existential flexibility is about.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Steve Jobs once visited another firm with a more useful user interface technology than Apple. He knew Apple had to invest in the technology. He faced a lot of opposition because Apple had already spent millions on the original user interface. Jobs replied: “If you are not willing to blow up your company, someone else will”.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">If an organisation does not change when they should, it will simply become irrelevant like Kodak who refused to invest in digital cameras instead of analogue ones and went bankrupt as a consequence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">The Courage to Lead</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">The 4 prior practices can bring organisations very far, but they are also difficult to pursue.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Some practices like strong direction changes and seeing employees as the most important party in a firm are rarely seen in modern business.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Leaders following those principles have to be courageous, willing to make short-term sacrifices and ready for a lot of headwind to be successful in the infinite game.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">How I Apply the Book to My Life</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">This book has inspired me to define a <a target="_blank" href="https://acquirable.ch/about">Just Cause for Acquirable</a>.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It has also given me a more refined idea of what it means to be successful while also being kind and ethical.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It also made me appreciate the amazing internship I had at the time even more. Also, where I was in charge, I could immediately apply some of the practices.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It helped me see others in my fields of interest as inspiration and potential collaborators instead of someone to beat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">My Two Favourite Quotes</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">“Leadership is not about being in charge, leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.”</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">“If you are not willing to blow up your company, someone else will do it for you.”, by Steve Jobs, quoted by Simon Sinek</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">What I Didn’t Like About the Book</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">It could have included more scientific insights (like studies or insights from psychology and philosophy).</p>
                </div>                
                <p class="article-text">Apart from that, there is not much to improve.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Who Should Read the Book</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People interested in psychology and philosophy</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">People interested in leadership, business and organisational structure</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">People who have not yet found a way to create a business or lead according to their principles</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Anyone interested in improving their professional situation.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">People interested in a clear, concise book with a lot of great examples highlighting the key points</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-title">Who Should Not</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People who prefer strongly science-backed, neutral books
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">“The Infinite Game” is a concise and fascinating book about modern leadership and organisations. It presents truly novel perspectives worth it to be read.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The book is suited for people interested in improving their careers and their knowledge in business, psychology and philosophy.</p>
                <p class="article-text">I can only recommend reading this book. Apart from that, checking out Simon Sineks talks like <a  target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/tye525dkfi8?si=JCAoYBt7jYM4AC0T">this one </a>is also a fantastic idea.</p>
