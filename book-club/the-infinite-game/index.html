                <h2 class="description"> 
                    A few months ago, I was exploring book summaries on the app <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.blinkist.com/en">Blinkist</a> and came across a book called “The Infinite Game”. It immediately caught my eye and had excellent ratings, so I gave it a read.
                </h2>
                <h2 class="description">15 minutes later, I was sold. I have never been so convinced to buy a book. It changed the way I think about leadership and the purpose of organisations. This change became even more prominent after reading the entire book. It was full of new ideas I had never heard of before. I was amazed and finished the book within 3 days.</h2>

                <p class="article-text">Simon Sinek is an author and speaker. His talks and books have reached and inspired millions of people. Nowadays, he also works together with many organisations and offers courses and a podcast. He describes himself as an “unshakeable optimist”. It’s therefore not surprising that his company is called “The Optimism Company”.

                <div class="sub-title">Key Takeaways</div>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Finite and Infinite Games</div>
                <p class="article-text">The key idea of the book is that companies and other organisations are in an infinite game.</p>
                <p class="article-text">
                    A finite game has a set beginning and end. It has rules everyone closely follows and there is a clear winner at the end (or a draw). A football match would be an example of a finite game.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">Companies and other organisations on the other hand are in an infinite game. There is no defined time when “business” starts or ends. Company A might have been created in 1853, Company B might only exist since 2025. There is also no finish line to run towards. If business “finishes”, the company has failed. Apart from legal guidelines, there are also no strict rules in the world of organisations.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Apart from that, a company also can’t “win” business. It could be the most popular one on earth or the one with the most employees, but that might be different tomorrow. There is no finish line. Trying to “beat” the competition is therefore absolutely pointless.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Instead of trying to beat the competition, organisations should try to outlast it through means of self-improvement. Thus, the only real competitor, the one to “beat”, is the organisation itself.</p>
                <p class="article-text">To become a better organisation, Sinek proposes 5 practices the company can pursue. We will now go through all of them.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">The Just Cause</div>
                <p class="article-text">The first practice is the Just Cause. Every organisation should have a cause “so just that employees would be willing to sacrifice their own interests to advance it”. In other words, the organisation should have a cause to work towards that makes employees feel happy and fulfilled, even if it requires sacrifices.</p>
                <p class="article-text">To be able to call a cause a “Just Cause”, it must fulfil the following criteria:</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">For something (instead of against): It improves something instead of fighting against something.</p>                    
                    <p class="bullet-point">Inclusive: It is open to all those who would like to contribute.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Service-oriented: It actually benefits others.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Resilient: No matter the political, technological or social situation, it stays relevant.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Idealistic: It’s a big goal that will never be fully reached (if it could be reached, it would not be ideal in the Infinite Game).</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">Let’s look at one of Sinek’s favourite examples: The US Declaration of Independence. It pursues equality, liberty and happiness for all men.</p>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">This cause is positive, (it is for something, instead of against e.g. the British tax policy).</p>                    
                    <p class="bullet-point">It’s inclusive for all men (”men” is to be understood as “people” in this context).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It’s service-oriented (equality, liberty and happiness are beneficial).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It’s resilient (equality, liberty and happiness stay relevant).</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It’s idealistic (we will never achieve full equality, liberty and happiness, but we can always make improvements).</p>
                </div>
                <p class="article-text">In an organisation pursuing a Just Cause, profit is only regarded as a necessary mean to continue pursuing the cause, not as the ultimate goal.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Trusting Teams</div>
                <p class="article-text">An organisation is only as good as the people who work there. That is why the employees should be prioritised and that is what the task of leaders is about. They are not responsible for the results, they are responsible for the people who are responsible for the results.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Leaders should create an environment where employees can work at their natural best. The employees should be able to ask questions, admit mistakes, talk about problems and bring their ideas without any fear of being judged, mistreated or fired. This is what a trusting team is all about.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Building a trusting team takes time, but it is achievable if leaders consistently take care of the employees - the ones responsible for the results and happy customers.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">A Worthy Rival</div>
                <p class="article-text">In the infinite game, your only true competitor is yourself. Competitiveness in the infinite game is therefore pointless. It only creates envy and insecurity and leads to bad decisions. So why should we seek a worthy rival nevertheless?</p>
                <p class="article-text">Envy and insecurity are not created by any competitor but by ourselves. By noticing that, we can convert the experience of seeing your rival being better at something than you into something positive: Learning. You can learn a lot from your competition. Their superiority in a certain area gives you free inspiration to improve yourself.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Simon Sinek has experienced rivalry himself. He talked about feeling insecure when comparing himself to Adam Grant, another author. Now, they are good friends and even work together, because “it turns out, people can buy more than one book”.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">Existential Flexibility</div>
                <p class="article-text">Existential flexibility is the fourth practice Sinek suggests. The Just Cause is the only constant in an organisation. The brand, the products, the structure - all of that is flexible. If those things fail to further help the company pursue the Just Cause, they should be changed, even if it requires sacrifice.</p>                
                <p class="article-text">Sinek here takes early-day Apple as an example. Their just cause is to enable individuals to create things as good as corporations. After visiting the firm Xerox and seeing their superior user interface (a graphical one like we know instead of just a command line tool), CEO Steve Jobs knew Apple had to invest in that technology.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Other people at Apple were not big fans of the idea, because they have already invested a lot in their current non-graphical user interface. To this, Jobs replied, “If you are not willing to blow up your company, someone else will”. Today, almost every personal computer has a graphical user interface.</p>
                <p class="article-text">This is what existential flexibility is about: “Blowing up” your organisation, so it stays relevant in the future and continues to play in the infinite game, even if it requires a lot of hard work and millions.</p>
                <div class="sub-sub-title">The Courage to Lead</div>
                <p class="article-text">The four prior practices can bring an organisation very far, but they are extremely difficult to pursue and leaders who choose to do so will face strong headwinds. That is why Sinek included another practice - courage to lead.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Having a Just Cause, valuing your employees and customers more than your shareholders, trying to learn from your competition and sometimes drastically changing direction are not common practices in the world. If you want to lead according to these principles, you need to have a lot of courage.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Leading in the infinite game requires sometimes very tough short-term sacrifices in favour of long-term success, but in the infinite game, it will be worth it.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">How I Could Apply That Knowledge to My Life</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">This book has inspired me to define a <a target="_blank" href="https://acquirable.ch/about">Just Cause for Acquirable</a>.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It has also given me a more refined idea of what it means to be successful while also being kind and ethical.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It also made me appreciate the amazing internship I had at the time even more. Where I was in charge, I could immediately apply some of the practices.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">It helped me see others in my fields of interest as inspiration and potential collaborators instead of someone to beat.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">My Two Favourite Quotes</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">“Leadership is not about being in charge, leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.”</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">“If you are not willing to blow up your company, someone else will do it for you.”, by Steve Jobs, quoted by Simon Sinek</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">What I Didn’t Like About the Book</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">It could have included more scientific insights (like studies or insights from psychology and philosophy).</p>
                </div>                
                <p class="article-text">Apart from that, there is not much to improve.</p>
                <div class="sub-title">Who Should Read the Book</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People interested in psychology and philosophy</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">People interested in leadership, business and organisational structure</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">People who have not yet found a way to create a business or lead according to their principles</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">Anyone interested in improving their professional situation.</p>
                    <p class="bullet-point">People interested in a clear, concise book with a lot of great examples highlighting the key points</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-title">Who Should Not</div>
                <div class="bullet-container">
                    <p class="bullet-point">People who prefer strongly science-backed, neutral books
                </div>
                <div class="sub-title">Conclusion</div>
                <p class="article-text">“The Infinite Game” is a concise and fascinating book about modern leadership and organisations. It presents truly novel perspectives worth it to be read.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The book is suited for people interested in improving their careers and their knowledge in business, psychology and philosophy.</p>
                <p class="article-text">I can only recommend reading this book. Apart from that, checking out Simon Sineks talks like <a  target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/tye525dkfi8?si=JCAoYBt7jYM4AC0T">this one </a>is also a fantastic idea.</p>
