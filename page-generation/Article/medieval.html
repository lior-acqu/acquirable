                <h2 class="description">In the Middle Ages, just a few hundred years ago, 80-90% of all people were farmers. They devoted their entire time to the production of food - well, apart from the occasional church visit. </h2><h2 class="description">Today, only 2.3% of all people in Switzerland work in agriculture, forestry, or fishing. In most other affluent countries, the numbers are similar. </h2><h2 class="description">This is more than a 30-fold decrease. At the same time, we are actually eating more food than medieval people. How is this possible?</h2>

<div class='sub-title'>Historical Productivity</div>
<p class='article-text'>Well, we became extremely efficient. Over hundreds of years, we have developed tools like tractors, harvesters, and fertilizers. Apart from that, we have also learnt a lot about animals, soils, and economics, and made use of that knowledge by constantly improving our procedures.</p>
<p class='article-text'>In summary, we have developed continually improving systems and tools that make us increasingly efficient.</p>
<p class='article-text'>From this big success (well, apart from the resulting environmental issues we’ve caused), we can learn a lot for our own lives.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>The Detriments of “Hustle Culture”</div>
<p class='article-text'>When we struggle to do something, there are multiple approaches to address the issue.</p>
<p class="article-text">Popular “hustle culture”, characterized by dubious characters such as Andrew Tate or Iman Gadzhi, tells us to be more disciplined, work harder, and use sketchy tricks.</p>
<p class='article-text'>Let’s play this through with our medieval example:</p>
<div class='bullet-container'><p class='bullet-point'>If we increased the farming population from 80%-90% to 100%, we would have approximately an 18% increase in productivity.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>If the farmers now worked for, let’s say, 19 hours a day instead of just 16 hours, we could increase productivity by another 19%.</p>
<p class='bullet-point'>Finally, if the farmers pulled off a real “alpha male high performer move” by ignoring the fallow year (a year in which the field is left unsown to recover, which we assume happens every 7 years), we could increase productivity by another 17%.</p>
</div>
<p class='article-text'>The result would be about a 63% increase in productivity. Not bad, but incomparable to the 3000%+ increase we’ve actually experienced. Also, the gains are fleeting: With everyone being a farmer on only 5 hours of rest per day, everyone would be completely exhausted, and the other parts of society would be entirely neglected. And without a fallow year, the fields will soon lose all nutrients.</p>
<p class="article-text">The long-term result is collapse.</p>
<div class='sub-title'>A Healthier Approach</div>
<p class='article-text'>So, instead, let’s learn from history. Let’s develop and discover systems, tools, and habits that make our endeavours efficient and, even more importantly, sustainable in the long run, just like humanity did in the case of farming.</p>
<p class='article-text'>How do we do this?</p>
<p class='article-text'>The most important practice is education. Learn from others who have achieved goals similar to yours. Find mentors, read books, get inspired by brilliant minds.</p>
<p class='article-text'>The second practice are thinking and problem-solving skills. Use your education to create, analyze, and evaluate solutions to your specific problems. After all, a solution like a harvester can do the work of multiple farmers in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p class='article-text'>The third practice is division of labor. To be more efficient, successful, and happy, focus on what truly gives us meaning in life, and leave the rest to other people, if possible. In my case, farming isn’t really my thing, but engineering is. So, I just buy the products from farmers, while I might build a new tool to make farming even more efficient.</p>
<p class='article-text'>As we see, often, the best approach is not blindly working harder to chase short-term goals, but becoming educated problem-solvers, capable of developing healthy systems and tools that last and make us happy.</p>
